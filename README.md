# Todo

This is a simple Todo application which fetches the current list of todos from an API. Currently its incomplete, your task is to add a new feature, the todo items themself should be able to contain a list of sub-tasks.

eg.

- [ ] Main task
- - [x] Sub-task 1
- - [ ] Sub-task 2

This app uses [Ant Design](https://ant.design/docs/react/introduce) UI library. The current todo list is implemented using [Ant Design Table component](https://ant.design/components/table/).

Implement the **Sub-task list** using the nested table feature of Ant Design Table component. Check the below link for the documentation.

[https://ant.design/components/table/#components-table-demo-nested-table](https://ant.design/components/table/#components-table-demo-nested-table)

Also implement **Add task button** to add a main task or sub-task. Please follow best UX practices while implementing the features.
